## Tech Stack

- React
- Vite for build tool
- React Router
- styled-components
- React Query
- React Hook Form

## What I learnt

- `useReducer` Hook and how to manage a more complex state beyond useState
- Different approach to dealing with "status" (loading, error, finish etc) because of the `Reducer` function
- Using `useEffect` hook to create a countdown timer based on the amount of questions in the quiz
